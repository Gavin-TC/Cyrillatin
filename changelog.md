# Changelog v1.30
## Fixed
- "щ" character never being converted. ("щ" character's phonic is now "shch." Probably will be changed later on.)

## Changed
- The following changes I find make typing out sentences much more intuitive and easier.
    - "и" character's phonic is now "i".
    - "ы" character's phonic is now "y".

## Planned
- Options page
    - This means possible options such as:
        - Changing how/when the conversion happens
        - Customizing the phonics 'library'
            - Importable/exportable phonics 'libaries'
