# Help with Cyrillatin
## How to use phonics?
- Here are the phonics that Cyrillatin will convert:
  - "ts", "ya", "ee", "sh", "sha", "zh", "kh", "yo", "ch", "yu", "y'", "u", "k", "n", "g", "f", "v", "a", "p", "r", "o", "l", "d", "z", "e", "s", "m", "i", "t", "b", and "y"
  - "TS", "YA", "EE", "SH", "SHA", "ZH", "KH", "YO", "CH", "YU", "Y'", "U", "K", "N", "G", "F", "V", "A", "P", "R", "O", "L", "D", "Z", "E", "S", "M", "I", "T", "B", and "Y"

## Why doesn't Cyrillatin work on [website]?
  - Cyrillatin works by detecting editable contents inside of a website. Sometimes these websites have measures in place that don't allow for automated/procedural replacing of text. 
  - - This can make some weird things happen, such as the website resetting the text to what is was before you converted. Sadly, I do not know if there is a way to circumvent this issue as it's usually done as a security measure.
